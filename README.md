### Challenge #1
Different lighthouse operators are given different size grids based on their skills. Every lighthouse operator likes to be able to boast about how large their grid is. Grids always start at A on the X-axis and never go above Z. They can have any number of rows. Let's figure out how large yours is!

Up above you have access to the printed-out grid, and the JS code for the grid. This is your grid, for your lighthouse.

Write a function called `gridSize()` that will tell you the size of your grid in the format width x height. Your function should return a string, and in this example, your function should return the string `"10 x 10"`. But you have to make sure that you figure that string out by actually measuring your grid!

> #### Hint
> We'll be checking it against other grids to see if your method works. These grids may have other sizes! They could be bigger than yours, so you need to make sure your code works for all sizes.

### Challenge #2
Awesome job! Other lighthouse operators are jealous of your grid, and your code skills. Just to show off, let's write a new function for the system which will count up how many cells total there are. Given the code you just wrote, this should be pretty easy.

Write a new function called `totalCells()` which will return the total number of cells in your grid. For this grid, it should return `100`, but again make sure that is a calculated value and not just a number you type in for your function to return. We want to make all the other lighthouse operators jealous.

Donâ€™t erase your past code when you work on the new challenge! Remember that the challenges are cumulative so you shouldnâ€™t erase any of your work once you finish a challenge. You will need functions created on prior days to complete future challenges!

> #### Hint
> Don't forget that you can access the grid up above at the Show Grid and Show Grid Code link. Your code can access the `GRID` variable. Make sure you code is using `return`, not `console.log`.

### Challenge #3
Okay, let's get our lighthouse actually doing some work! As the lighthouse keeper, sometimes you'll need to shine the light directly on a particular cell in the grid, to alert passing ships to a danger there.

Your job is to write a function called lightCell() that takes in the coordinates in the form of `'A3'` or `'J9'` and returns the contents of that specific cell. (Ex: `lightCell('B4');` would return `""`)

Donâ€™t erase your past code when you work on the new challenge! Remember that the challenges are cumulative so you shouldnâ€™t erase any of your work once you finish a challenge. You will need functions created on prior days to complete future challenges!

> #### Hint
> How would you split the text passed to the function? Then, how do you translate a letter into a number? This is your first function that requires a parameter.

### Challenge #4
In the area where the lighthouse is watching, the grid, there are many rocks which ships would need to avoid. Rocks are indicated with the `^` symbol on the grid.

Write a function called `isRock()` which will take in a coordinate in the form of `'C7'` and return a true or a false boolean value depending on whether there is a rock in that cell or not. (Example: `isRock('D1');` would return `true`)

> #### Hint

### Challenge #5
There are also areas where the currents are too strong for boats to be effective, and boats run the risk of being smashed up against the rocks if they get caught here. Strong currents are indicated with the `~` symbol.

Write a function called `isCurrent()` which will take in a coordinate in the form of `'A4'` and return a true or a false boolean value depending on whether there is a strong current in that cell or not. (Example: `isCurrent('E2');` would return `true`)

### Challenge #6
Your next job is to write a loop so that your lighthouse can sweep a whole row of cells.

To do this, write a function named `lightRow()` that takes in the number of the row and returns the contents of the cell. (Example: `lightRow(2);` would return `["", "", "", "", "~", "", "", "", "", ""]`)

### Challenge #7
Now that you can return the contents of the cells of a row, we also need to be able to return the cells of a column.

Write a function called `lightColumn()` that takes in the letter of the column from the grid, and returns an array that is the contents of that grid column. (Ex: `lightColumn('C');` would return `["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "~", "", ""]`)

### Challenge #8
The weekend lighthouse operator isn't as smart as you are, and sometimes tells the Lighthouse9000â„¢ system to do invalid things, causing the repairman to have to come out and fix the lighthouse. Upgrade the `lightCell()` method so that if an invalid cell is passed in, it returns `false`. (Example: `lightCell('Z3');` would return false as would `lightCell('A11');`)

> #### Hint
> The first character should be less than the last column of your GRID, and the second character should be a number between 1 and the last row. This is where grid sizes become more important.

### Challenge #9
The other lighthouse operators are impressed that you figured out how to find rocks and currents, but they also need a method to identify safe cells. A cell is safe if there is no rock or strong current in that cell.

Write a function called `isSafe()` which will take in a coordinate in the form of `'H2'` and return a true or a false boolean. The `isSafe()` function should check to see if there is a rock or current or not in that cell. (Example: `isSafe('D7');` would return `true`)

### Challenge #10
Environment Canada has called and wants a report sent to them of all the rocks in your grid, for use in their latest map.

Write a function called `allRocks()` which when called will return an array of the coordinates of all the rocks in your grid. (Example: `allRocks()` should return `["D1", "E3", "F3", "E4", "F4", "B8", "H8", "B9", "B10"]`)

> #### Hint
> Environment Canada wants you to send them your function as they may use it on other grids. You need to write code that will filter out the cells with rocks in them, not just reply with a hard-coded response.

### Challenge #11
Since you were so impressive with the finding of rocks, Environment Canada wants you to do the same thing for strong currents. Again, they're going to use your function, so you have to write code that goes through the grid and finds the cells with strong currents.

Write a function called `allCurrents()` which, when called, will return an array of the coordinates of all the strong currents in your grid. (Example: `allCurrents()` should return `["E2", "C8", "D8", "D9", "E9", "E10", "F10"]`)

### Challenge #12
Here is an opportunity to prove how powerful your lighthouse-powering skills are! Look at the code for Challenge #10, and write a function called `firstRock()` which will return the coordinates of the first rock in your grid.

> #### Hint
> Don't just rewrite the code from #10! Use your `allRocks()` function again.

### Challenge #13
That was outstanding! Now do the same thing with `firstCurrent()`. Don't reinvent the wheel here. Re-use existing code from Challenge #11. This is one of the most important skills you can build as a coder...er, uh, I mean lighthouse operator.

### Challenge #14
Ship captains are really starting to rely on you to plot their routes through your area. Your name is being sung in pubs and taverns up and down the coast. And this time, it's for the right reasons! The ship captains are starting to be curious about some of the cells in your grid, and what they want is to know if a cell is dangerous. They know if ones are safe, but sometimes, they are willing to accept a bit of danger so that they can get a faster delivery time.

A cell is considered dangerous if there is a rock or a strong current in it, OR in the cells immediately above, below, left, or right of it. Write a function called `isDangerous()` that will take a cell in the format `'G7'` and return a true or a false value. (Example: `isDangerous('E4')` would return true, because there is a rock there. Similarly, `isDangerous('B9')` would return true, because there are rocks and currents AROUND the cell. However, `isDangerous('I6')` would return false because it is open water.)

> #### Hint
> Assume that if a cell is on the edge, anything outside of the grid is safe. This is literally why we call things like this `edge` cases.

### Challenge #15
HELP! A ship is in trouble and is firing off a distress beacon, with their coordinates. You need to look at all the cells around the ship and decide which cell is the best one for them to go to.

Rules:
- Target cell should not be dangerous.
- Target cell should be 1 cell away in any direction.
- Write a function called `distressBeacon()` that takes a coordinate in the format `'H2'` and returns a different coordinate in the same format. (Example: `distressBeacon('E8')` should return `'F7'`.)

### Challenge #16
The only constant is change around here! The diving society has sunk a wreck in your grid to give divers a great place to scuba and swim around. Add a rock to your grid in cell J9.

### Challenge #17
It's time for monthly reporting to Lighthouse HQ. Your supervisor calls you and tells you that they need a report of what percentage of your grid is rocks and what percentage has strong currents. This data should be sent as an array of two values, in that order.

Write a function `percentageReport()` that returns the right percentages. (Example: calling `percentageReport()` should return the following array: `[10, 7]`)

> #### Hint
> If you get fractions, round them to two decimal places

### Challenge #18
Apparently, HQ can't count. They want you to re-do your report, but this time send back three values. The first should be the number of open water cells, the second should be the number of rock cells, and the third should be the number of strong current cells. This is why we have software!

### Challenge #19
Lighthouse HQ also wants a report of the safety of your `GRID`. Write another function called `safetyReport()`, which returns the percentage of your grid that contains calm waters. Calm waters do not contain a rock or a strong current. Lighthouse HQ sent further instructions. They said that due to system limitations in the Lighthouse 9000&trade;, you must use the `reduce()` function in your code.

The return value should be a string in the form "##%". If there are any decimals, it should be rounded to 1 decimal point.

> #### Hint
> Re-use code! Use the reduce method for arrays, see the [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce). Remember, your function should work for any size `GRID`.

### Challenge #20
Ship captains have heard of your prowess and want to know the length of their routes through your grid.

Write a function called `calcDistance()` which will take two coordinates in the form of `'A3'` and calculate the distance between the two points. (Example: calling `calcDistance('A1', 'C3')` should return `2.83`).

> #### Hint
> You can find the formula for calculating the distance between two points [here](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/geometry-plane/distance-two-points.php).

## Challenge #21
This is it, the last challenge! Is that inspirational music in the background?

You have worked hard to get to this point and now you are about to be rewarded. First, thereâ€™s the satisfaction of coding for 21 days in a row (yay!). But, once you finish the 21-Day Coding Challenge you will be entered to win one of many great prizes including: a Macbook Pro, a Sphero, and a Rasberry Pi.

Given that you can do all sorts of fancy analysis on your grid, we're going to give you the final challenge for your Lighthouse9000â„¢ system. Ship captains are going to send you a series of cells that they want to travel through, not just their start and end cells. You need to let them know if they should use that route or not.

Write a function `evaluateRoute()` which will take an array of cells in the form: `["A1", "B2", "C3", "D4"]` (there could be any number of cells), and return a boolean true or false according to the following rules:

- If any cells have rocks, it should return false.
- If more than two cells have strong currents, it should return false.
- Otherwise, it should return true.
